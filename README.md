# ClustrPairs

This package takes in "Pair1  Pair2 Similarity_score" (tab seperated) and cluster the pairs which have threshold similirity cutoff 80. 
The similarity cutoff should be between 1 to 100.
The final output contains unique list of pairs and their corresponding cluster number. 
Additionally a small graph of connected component is also generated.
